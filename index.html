      <section>
          <p>I am currently a Clinical Research Coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital. 
            I graduated in December 2022 with a dual degree from University of Pennsylvania, where I pursued studies in three schools (Wharton, College, Engineering); I majored in Statistics, Cognitive Science, and Computer Science and minored in Mathematics. I completed pre-medical postbaccalaureate coursework at Harvard Extension School. 

        <p>My research experience lies across health services, health equity, AI ethics, human-computer interaction, machine learning, natural language processing, and computational social science.
          At <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center">Mass General Cancer Center</a>, I managed a study of a virtual cancer and mental health tumor board, focusing on health disparities among individuals with serious mental illness and cancer.
          My honors thesis involved the use of natural language generation with the goal of aiding peer counselors in generating messages incorporating reflective listening.  
          In 2021, I conducted research at <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">CMU's Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>, developing a platform for training nurses in
          motivational interviewing and framing the evidence-based design of the prototype.

        <p>I have spent time at non-profits, startups, and a software company. Currently, I help support the care of patients at the MGH street team clinic of <a href="https://www.bhchp.org/">Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program</a>.
          Prior to moving to Boston, I worked on building the member relationship management system MVP for <a href="https://www.vanna.health/">Vanna Health</a>, 
          a company focused on providing psychosocial rehabilation at scale to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. During my time at Penn, I focused on search and selection of entrepreneurs at <a href="https://endeavor.org/">Endeavor</a>,
          building a curriculum to empower the next generation of social entrepreneurs at <a
          href="https://fulphil.org/">Fulphil</a>, and underscoring customer value in enterprise software at <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow</a>.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I have volunteered as a crisis counselor at hotlines, formerly at <a href="https://www.teenline.org/">Teen Line</a> and since then, at <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/">Crisis Text Line</a>. My mission is to support people and their health.</p>
