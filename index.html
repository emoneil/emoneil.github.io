      <section>
        <p>I’m an undergraduate senior graduating in December 2022 from Los Angeles studying Statistics, Cognitive Science, and Computer Science at 
        <a href="https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/">The Wharton School</a> and the
        <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a> through a dual degree.</p>

        <p>My interests exist at the intersection of research, technology, entrepreneurship, and social impact. 
          My research experience lies within human-computer interaction and computational social science. I am especially excited by research 
          exploring the use of innovative technology to improve the lives of those living with mental health challenges and their communities.
          My honors thesis is using NLG with the goal of aiding peer counselors in generating messages employing the clinical skill of reflection.  
          In Summer 2021, I conducted research at <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>, developing a platform for training nurses to conduct 
          motivational interviewing. I have continued research on the project, framing the evidence-based design rationale for the developed prototype. 
          This summer I will be conducting research at University of Washington through the <a href="https://dub.washington.edu/">Design, Use, Build</a> initiative.</p>
        
        <p>I have spent time at non-profits, startups, and mid-size companies. I focused on the search and selection of entrepreneurs at <a href="https://endeavor.org/">Endeavor</a>,
          building a curriculum to help empower the next generation of socially impactful entrepreneurs at <a
          href="https://fulphil.org/">Fulphil</a>, and underscoring customer value in the enterprise software space at <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow</a>.</p>

        <p>Other things I think a lot about are the societal impacts of technology and fostering an inclusive CS community. 
          I am passionate about telling stories with data and care a lot about mental health advocacy. 
          I have been volunteering at crisis hotlines since 2016 and am currently a Crisis Counselor at <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/">Crisis Textline</a>.
          My mission is to advance mental health empowerment and support through technology.</p>
