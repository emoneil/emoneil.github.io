      <section>
          <p>I am a Clinical Research Coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital in the <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/clinical-trials-and-research/cancer-outcomes-research">Cancer Outcomes Research and Education Program</a>, working on research on collaborative care for people with serious mental illness and cancer and focusing on closing the cancer mortality gap for individuals with mental illness. 
            I graduated in December 2022 with a dual degree from <a href="https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/">The Wharton School</a> and <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I majored in Statistics, Cognitive Science, and Computer Science and minored in Mathematics. This past year, I completed pre-medical postbaccalaureate coursework at Harvard. 

        <p>I am particularly passionate about mental health research, policy, and technology as well as questions in precision medicine, machine-in-the-loop systems in healthcare, psychiatry, integrated care, physician-patient interaction, and health equity. 
          My research experience lies within health services, human-computer interaction, machine learning, natural language processing, and computational social science.
          My honors thesis involved the use of natural language generation with the goal of aiding peer counselors in generating messages employing the clinical skill of reflection.  
          In 2021, I conducted research at <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>, developing a platform for training nurses to conduct 
          motivational interviewing and framing the evidence-based design of the prototype.

        <p>I have spent time at non-profits, startups, and a software company. Most recently, I worked on building the member relationship management system MVP for <a href="https://www.vanna.health/">Vanna Health</a>, 
          a company focused on providing psychosocial rehabilation at scale to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. During my time at Penn, I focused on search and selection of entrepreneurs at <a href="https://endeavor.org/">Endeavor</a>,
          building a curriculum to empower the next generation of social entrepreneurs at <a
          href="https://fulphil.org/">Fulphil</a>, and underscoring customer value in enterprise software at <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow</a>.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I have volunteered as a crisis counselor at hotlines, formerly at <a href="https://www.teenline.org/">Teen Line</a> and currently at <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/">Crisis Text Line</a>.
          My mission is to advance mental health empowerment and support.</p>
